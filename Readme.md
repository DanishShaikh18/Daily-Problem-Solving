# 🔥 Daily Problem Solving

This repository documents my ongoing journey of solving daily coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, CodeForces, and more. Each solution is thoughtfully structured and categorized by difficulty to support long-term learning, topic-wise revision, and interview preparation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Easy/` – Problems tagged as easy
- `Medium/` – Problems tagged as medium
- `Hard/` – Problems tagged as hard

## Each file is named in the format:

<problem_number>-<problem-title>.py

Example:
```python
121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py
```

🚀 Goals
✅ Build a consistent daily DSA habit
⚡ Enhance problem-solving speed and accuracy
🧠 Strengthen algorithmic thinking and code readability
💼 Prepare for technical interviews through structured practice

🛠️ Languages Used
Python (primary)
C++ (occasionally)
