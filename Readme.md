# 🔥 Daily Problem Solving

This repository tracks my journey of solving coding problems daily from platforms like **Leetcode**, **CodeForces**, and more. Problems are organized by difficulty for clarity and long-term revision.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Easy/` – Problems tagged as easy
- `Medium/` – Problems tagged as medium
- `Hard/` – Problems tagged as hard

##Each file is named in the format:

<problem_number>-<problem-title>.py

Example:
```python
121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py
```

🚀 Goals
Maintain consistency in solving daily DSA problems
Improve problem-solving speed and code clarity
Prepare for interviews with topic-focused revision

🛠️ Languages Used
Python (primary)
C++ (occasionally)
